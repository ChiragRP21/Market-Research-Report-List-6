<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Iodide Contrast Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ion Type</li><li>Non-ionic Type</li><li>Nonionic Dimers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The organic iodide contrast agents market is divided into three main types. Ion type contrast agents are water-soluble, high-osmolar agents that provide excellent imaging but may cause adverse reactions. Non-ionic types are low-osmolar agents, safer, and more widely used in diagnostic imaging due to lower side effects. Nonionic dimers combine two molecules, further reducing osmolality and enhancing safety and efficacy, making them suitable for patients with sensitivities, and improving overall image quality in radiological procedures.</p></p>
