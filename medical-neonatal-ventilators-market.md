<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical neonatal ventilators market is segmented into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver air directly into the lungs, often required for critically ill premature infants. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support without direct airway access, utilizing masks or nasal interfaces to assist breathing. Both types are essential for managing respiratory distress in neonates, addressing varying severity levels of respiratory issues.</p></p>
