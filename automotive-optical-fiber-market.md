<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Optical Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Single-Mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Optical Fiber market is primarily divided into two types: multimode fiber and single-mode fiber. Multimode fiber, characterized by its ability to carry multiple light modes simultaneously, is well-suited for short-distance applications, making it ideal for in-vehicle communications. Single-mode fiber, on the other hand, allows only one mode of light to propagate, facilitating long-distance data transmission with minimal loss. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing connectivity, data transfer speeds, and overall vehicle performance in modern automotive systems.</p></p>
