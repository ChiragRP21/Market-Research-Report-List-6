<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acoustic Vehicle Alert System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Acoustic Vehicle Alert System (AVAS) market primarily focuses on two vehicle types: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs rely solely on electric power, necessitating AVAS to ensure pedestrian safety due to their near-silent operation. PHEVs, which can switch between electric and conventional fuel sources, also require sound emissions at low speeds to alert pedestrians. Both segments emphasize the importance of acoustic alerts in urban environments, promoting safety while enhancing the driving experience.</p></p>
