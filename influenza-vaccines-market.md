<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Influenza Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trivalent Flu Vaccines</li><li>Quadrivalent Flu Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The influenza vaccine market is primarily divided into trivalent and quadrivalent formulations. Trivalent flu vaccines protect against three strains of the virus—typically two influenza A strains and one B strain—making them effective yet limited in coverage. Quadrivalent flu vaccines, on the other hand, offer broader protection by including two A strains and two B strains, addressing a wider range of circulating viruses. This expanded coverage is increasingly preferred, as it enhances immunity during flu seasons with varied strain prevalence.</p></p>
