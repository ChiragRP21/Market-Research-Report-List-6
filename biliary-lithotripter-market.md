<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biliary Lithotripter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Lithotripter</li><li>Ultrasonic Lithotripter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biliary lithotripter market is categorized into two main types: mechanical lithotripters and ultrasonic lithotripters. Mechanical lithotripters use physical force to fragment gallstones, making them easier to remove. They typically employ devices like balloon catheters to apply pressure. In contrast, ultrasonic lithotripters utilize high-frequency sound waves to disintegrate stones, providing a less invasive option with minimal tissue damage. Both technologies aim to enhance the effectiveness of stone removal procedures while improving patient outcomes in biliary treatments.</p></p>
