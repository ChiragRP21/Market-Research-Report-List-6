<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Air Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Disc Brake</li><li>Air Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial air brake market primarily consists of two types: air disc brakes and air drum brakes. Air disc brakes use a rotor and caliper system for efficient braking performance, offering better heat dissipation and shorter stopping distances, making them preferable for heavy-duty vehicles. In contrast, air drum brakes utilize a drum and shoes mechanism, providing reliability and lower costs, though they may experience more heat buildup. Both systems are essential for ensuring safety and performance in commercial transportation.</p></p>
