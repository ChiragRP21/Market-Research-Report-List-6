<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temperature Sensitive Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible</li><li>Irreversible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The temperature-sensitive coating market consists of two primary types: reversible and irreversible coatings. Reversible coatings change color or properties in response to temperature variations but return to their original state once the temperature normalizes. These are often used for indicators and safety applications. In contrast, irreversible coatings undergo a permanent change when exposed to specific temperatures, serving as a reliable method for detection or monitoring by providing a lasting indication of temperature exposure. Both types cater to diverse industries, such as automotive and pharmaceuticals.</p></p>
