<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Neuromonitoring Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non Invasive</li><li>Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Veterinary Neuromonitoring Device market can be divided into two types: Non-Invasive and Invasive. Non-Invasive devices are used externally to monitor neurological activity without penetrating the body, making them safer and easier to use. Invasive devices, on the other hand, require insertion into the body to directly monitor brain or nerve function. While Invasive devices provide more accurate results, they also carry a higher risk of complications and require specialized training to use effectively. Both types of devices play a crucial role in monitoring and diagnosing neurological disorders in animals.</p></p>
