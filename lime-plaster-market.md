<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lime Plaster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrated Lime</li><li>Non-Hydraulic Lime</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lime plaster market is primarily divided into two types: hydrated lime and non-hydraulic lime. Hydrated lime, produced by adding water to quicklime, is valued for its adaptability and ability to create strong, durable plasters suitable for various applications, including modern construction. Non-hydraulic lime, however, relies on carbon dioxide from the air to harden, making it ideal for historical restorations and traditional buildings, providing breathability and flexibility in moisture management. Both types cater to distinct construction needs.</p></p>
