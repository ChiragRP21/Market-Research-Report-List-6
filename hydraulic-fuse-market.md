<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Fuse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Relief Type</li><li>Reflux Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydraulic fuse market encompasses two primary types: pressure relief type and reflux type. Pressure relief fuses are designed to prevent system overpressure by releasing fluid when a set pressure threshold is exceeded, thus protecting hydraulic components. Conversely, reflux types ensure that hydraulic fluid can only flow in one direction, preventing backflow and maintaining system integrity. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing safety and efficiency in hydraulic systems across various applications, including industrial machinery and aerospace.</p></p>
