<p><h1>Metal Neurovascular Stent Market Growth, Market Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts for period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Metal Neurovascular Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A metal neurovascular stent is a medical device used in the treatment of neurovascular diseases such as aneurysms and stenosis. It is designed to provide support to blood vessels in the brain, prevent blockages, and facilitate blood flow. The metal neurovascular stent market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.00% during the forecast period, driven by factors such as an increasing prevalence of neurovascular diseases, technological advancements in stent design, and growing awareness about minimally invasive treatment options.</p><p>The market is witnessing a trend towards the development of bioresorbable stents, which are designed to gradually dissolve in the body after fulfilling their purpose. This eliminates the need for long-term medication and reduces the risk of late complications associated with permanent stents. Additionally, there is a growing demand for drug-eluting stents, which release medication to prevent restenosis and improve patient outcomes.</p><p>Geographically, North America is expected to dominate the metal neurovascular stent market, owing to the presence of well-established healthcare infrastructure, favorable reimbursement policies, and increasing adoption of advanced medical technologies. However, Asia Pacific is projected to witness significant growth during the forecast period due to improving healthcare facilities and rising healthcare expenditure in the region.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Neurovascular Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Carotid artery stents</li><li>Intracranial stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal neurovascular stents are a type of medical device used to treat blockages or narrowings in blood vessels of the brain. The market for metal neurovascular stents can be categorized into two main types: carotid artery stents and intracranial stents. Carotid artery stents are designed to treat blockages in the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain. Intracranial stents, on the other hand, are used to treat blockages within the blood vessels of the brain itself. Both types of stents help to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of stroke or other complications.</p></p>
