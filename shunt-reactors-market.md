<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shunt Reactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-core Dry Type</li><li>Oil Immersed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shunt reactors are essential for the stability and efficiency of electrical power systems, and they come in two main market types: air-core dry type and oil-immersed type. Air-core dry type shunt reactors utilize a core made from air, providing insulation and reducing the risk of fire. They are mainly used in indoor applications. Oil-immersed type shunt reactors, conversely, use oil for cooling and insulation, making them suitable for outdoor installations and offering better thermal performance. Both types play a crucial role in voltage regulation and reactive power support.</p></p>
