<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System</li><li>Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market is primarily divided into two types: Indirect TPMS and Direct TPMS. Indirect TPMS utilizes the vehicle's ABS sensors to monitor wheel speed differences, indirectly inferring tire pressure changes. In contrast, Direct TPMS involves pressure sensors mounted on each tire, providing real-time data on tire pressure directly to the driver. Both systems enhance safety and performance by alerting drivers to under-inflated tires, contributing to better fuel efficiency and reduced accident risks.</p></p>
