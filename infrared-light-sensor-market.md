<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Light Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Light Sensor</li><li>Non-Contact Light Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared light sensors can be divided into two main types: contact light sensors and non-contact light sensors. Contact light sensors require physical contact with the object being measured, providing accurate and detailed data. On the other hand, non-contact light sensors can measure objects from a distance without the need for direct contact, making them more versatile and suitable for applications where physical contact is not possible or desired. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in various industries such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and consumer electronics.</p></p>
