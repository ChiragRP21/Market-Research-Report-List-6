<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Indicating Paint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible</li><li>Irreversible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heat indicating paint market is categorized into two main types: reversible and irreversible. Reversible heat indicating paints change color in response to temperature fluctuations and revert to their original hue once cooled, allowing for repeated use. In contrast, irreversible heat indicating paints undergo a permanent color change when exposed to certain temperatures, indicating that a specific heat threshold has been surpassed. These distinct characteristics enable various applications, such as safety monitoring and equipment testing in industries requiring temperature management.</p></p>
