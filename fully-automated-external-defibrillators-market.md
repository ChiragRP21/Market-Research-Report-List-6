<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Automated External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Wave</li><li>Biphase Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fully Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are categorized into two main types based on their waveforms: Single Phase Wave and Biphase Wave. Single Phase Wave AEDs deliver a unidirectional shock, which is generally effective but less efficient in some cases. In contrast, Biphase Wave AEDs utilize a bidirectional shock waveform, which allows for better defibrillation with reduced energy levels, enhancing patient outcomes. The Biphase Wave AEDs are increasingly preferred in the market due to their superior efficacy and safety profile.</p></p>
