<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Cooling for Data Center Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Cooling</li><li>Two Phase Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid cooling for data centers involves two primary market types: single-phase cooling and two-phase cooling. Single-phase cooling utilizes a liquid that remains in a liquid state throughout the cooling process, effectively transferring heat away from equipment using chilled water or coolant. In contrast, two-phase cooling involves a phase change, where the liquid absorbs heat and vaporizes, providing superior heat transfer efficiency. Both methods optimize temperature regulation and energy efficiency, essential for maintaining performance in high-density data center environments.</p></p>
