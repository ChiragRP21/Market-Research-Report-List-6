<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Leak Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contacting Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water leak sensor market is categorized into two main types: contact type and non-contacting type. Contact type sensors directly interact with water to detect leaks, often using probes that trigger alarms when moisture is detected. Non-contacting type sensors, on the other hand, utilize advanced technologies like ultrasonic or infrared to sense changes in the environment, detecting leaks without direct contact. Both types aim to prevent water damage, but they cater to different installation and monitoring preferences in residential and commercial settings.</p></p>
